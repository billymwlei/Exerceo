<b>How we represent the spirit of Govhack?</b></br>
Firstly we represent the multicultural nature of Australia with cultural links to Taiwan, Sri Lanka, United States of America, Russia, Hong Kong and Japan. Secondly we are passionate about getting involved with govhack. For example, Nick drove all the way from Cairns (a 5 day drive) to take part in the Brisbane Govhack event.

<b>What is our app idea?</b><br>
Our app idea is to help people from different cultural backgrounds form friendships with local Australians through playing sport. Sport is a great way of making friends with people from different backgrounds and cultures. However how many times have you wanted to play sport but couldn’t because you didn’t know enough people to play with or didn’t know where to play. With government open data we launched Exerceo to fix this problem.  Exerceo is an iOS app which provides a simple and easy way to find places to play sport as well as find people to play sport with. Exerceo uses 8 data sources about sport facilities from 4 different states and territories including Qld, NSW, Victoria and ACT to help find where to play. Exerceo also uses multiple language support including Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Korean (as well as English of course!) in order to make it easy for people from diverse backgrounds to play sport and form friendships.   

 <b>How does Exerceo work?</b><br>
Let say I am new to Brisbane and I want to play Basketball.  I don’t know much English so I choose Chinese which is the language I am most familiar with. I use the app to easily locate the nearest Basketball Court to where I am and then decide to create an event. In addition to this I can rate the venue as well as leave comments.  Then other people such as local Australians will see this event and decide to join it.  A great way of making some new Australian friends!
